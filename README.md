# Domain Switcher Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that allows you to quickly switch between different domains while preserving the current path, query parameters, and hash.

## Features

- **Domain Switching**: Replace the domain of the current URL while keeping the same path and parameters
- **Save Domains**: Save frequently used domains for quick access 
- **Simple Interface**: Clean and intuitive user interface
- **Cross-device Sync**: Saved domains sync across devices where you're signed into Chrome

## How It Works

This extension makes it easy to navigate between different environments (development, testing, production) or simply switch between different domains while staying on the same page path.

For example, if you're on `https://www.example.com/products?id=123` and switch to `newdomain.com`, you'll be taken to `https://newdomain.com/products?id=123`. You can also switch to local development environments by entering domains with ports like `localhost:3000`.
